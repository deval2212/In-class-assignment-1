    <h1>Web foundation</h1>

    <p> The web foundation was founded by Tim Berners-lee. The concept of web foundation are decentralization, universality and non- descrimination.
        HTTP, HTML and URL are the three foundation technologies in today's web. For example, there's a website (https://www.conestogac.on.ca/). It contains protocol('https') and domain('www.conestogac.on.ca').
    </p>
    <p> There's another interesting topic in web foundation which is known as 'IP address'. Which has several parts such as IPv4 and IPv6. Ipv4 Conatins 32-bit numbers and IPv6 contains 128-bit numbers.
        they both are represented by dotted decimal and hexa decimal notation. There are two models in web foundation OSI model and TCP/IP model.
        OSI model contains 7 layers whereas TCP/Ip model contains 4 layers and every layer has it's own tasks to perform.
